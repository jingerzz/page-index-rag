# Documentation

This folder is the minimal documentation scaffold for the PageIndex project.

- `architecture.md`: current architecture and component boundaries.
- `roadmap.md`: near-term and medium-term priorities.

As the project evolves, this directory can expand into API docs, evaluation notes, and design proposals.
